## The Application

The objective was to create a responsive website using semantic HTML, utilizing jQuery calls targeting 2 API's - National Park Service, and Open Weather App.
We took the the information returned from the API calls and dynamically added them to the page with the tools learned thus far in class. Park information is displayed, and a 3 day forecast for your convenience if you're planning a hike or camp.

## Process
Our process came to a halt when we we setup our API calls to append on the page. Long story short we had a template that was preventing us from using DOM manipulation in the manner we intended.
We completely overhauled the project to get to the website to the point where MVP is maintained and functionality of the site is working.
Joe had issues with branches on Github, and found out very fast that the process for creating the branches and merging upstream is VITAL. 


## Development and Technologies utilized

Our group learned so much during this project,  mainly communication and for me-Joe I learned that following directions every single step of the way is VITAL. 
-Github hosts our repo
-Git is the version control
-CSS to style the container
-HTML created DOM elements with
-javascript dynamically change the html on the DOM
